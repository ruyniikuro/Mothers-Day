                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I am one of the best people you will ever get the pleasure to know.  I am funny, witty, smart, and a Firecracker to boot.  I have an amazing husband who would kill for me, Two strong boys that would beat anyone up for me, A strong daughter that looks up to me, and 3 Fur-babies that will bite anyone who attacks me.  I have friends that will put their life and careers on the line for me. I have parents that love me no matter what I do and siblings that love and cherish me to death.  I may not have ever been in the military but I have an arsenal of friends and family who are like a small army.</p>
